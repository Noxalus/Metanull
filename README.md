Digital cameras and mobile phones create image file formats such as JPEG. These files contains hidden data or metadata called EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) which can include the date, time and sometimes the GPS coordinates of the picture, the brand and serial number of the device which took it as well as a thumbnail of the original image. Metanull can remove the metadata from your image files so the image you have won't have kind of information that identify you in it.

To avoid these kind of issues you can remove metadata selectively, that is by removing sensitive information but keeping other useful information in the images. This can be achieved in Windows, right clicking on and selecting properties, details tab, you can remove metadata from here. But if you have large number of photos that you want to remove Exif or metadata Windows Explorer is not the convenient way to do that.

Metanull is a portable Windows application that can remove metadata from your photos or images. It can be used to remove exif data from single or multiple images. The program is simple to use, select a single image or select a folder to batch remove meta information. Then select where you want to store meta data stripped images. Once done just hit the Null It button.

It will do the job in a min or so depending on the number of images you through at it. See the below image showing before and after stripping exif data with the program.
